## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal in the desired directory and enter the following command:

    ```bash
    gh repo clone RaphaelTheStegosaurus/Sample-Scratcher
    ```

2.  **Run the Server:** As this is a "Vanilla" JavaScript, CSS, and HTML project (no frameworks), you can easily run it using a web server extension for Visual Studio Code (like "Live Server") or by opening the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

---
## Usage
This is a functional project ready for testing. While its functionality on **Android** has been confirmed, collaboration is needed to confirm its proper operation on **iOS (iPhone)** devices.

### Customization

You can modify the project to suit your needs:

* **HTML:** Change the image that is revealed (the "prize") by editing the HTML code.
* **CSS:** Modify the background color and the color of the canvas that is scratched off. A comment is left in the CSS for quick reference if you wish to replace the canvas color with an image (an option not used in the current version).
* **JavaScript:** You can change the revealing "brushes." **Recommendation:** Use $50\text{px} \times 50\text{px}$ images for optimal application performance.

## Features
* **Technology:** Developed using pure **JavaScript, CSS, and HTML** (*Vanilla*), with no external dependencies, libraries, or frameworks.
* **Adaptability:** The "scratch-off" mechanism can be easily implemented in larger projects that use modern frameworks like **React/Next.js (with TypeScript), Vue, or Angular**.
* **Responsive:** Adaptable design for an excellent experience on **mobile** and **desktop**.
